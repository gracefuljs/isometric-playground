# isometric-playground
Playing with isometric projections using vanilla Javascript after watching Coding Math's video. More and more material will be added to extend the information. The code is broken down, simplified and heavily commented to be used as a a learning aid. It's definitley not meant to be used for production.

In the future, I will create my own tileset, but until then, the tileset is provided by [spasquini via DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/spasquini/art/Isometric-new-tiles-274882986).
