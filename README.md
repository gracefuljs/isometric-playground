# isometric-playground
Playing with isometric projections using vanilla Javascript after watching Coding Math's video. More and more material will be added to extend the information. While this used to be a learning aid, more and more features have been added to the point that I now want to make a full-fledged project with it. This is not going to be an engine of any kind. 

### Character Movement

The player controls the character Violet. He can navigate through the map via the directional keys and by clicking on valid, traversable tiles. It uses a primitive A* pathfinder.


### Other Characters and Interactions

While there are other characters in the game, the player can't interact with them just yet.


### Maps
In the future, I will create my own tileset, but until then, the tileset is provided by [spasquini via DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/spasquini/art/Isometric-new-tiles-274882986). The character sketches are mine.

See demo [here](https://gracefuljs.github.io/isometric-playground). As of right now, it's a little janky on mobile, but I'm working on fixing it.
